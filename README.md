# VBA Game Collection

## Overview
This project features a collection of classic board games implemented in VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) within Microsoft Excel. The games include Battleship, Connect 4, and Noughts and Crosses (Tic-Tac-Toe). Each game is fully functional and designed to run directly within an Excel workbook.

## Games Included
- **Battleship:** 
  - A two-player game where each player strategically places their ships on a grid and then tries to sink the opponent's fleet by guessing the coordinates of their ships.
- **Connect 4:** 
  - A two-player game where players take turns dropping discs into a vertical grid, aiming to align four discs of their color in a rowâ€”either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- **Noughts and Crosses (Tic-Tac-Toe):** 
  - A simple yet classic two-player game where players alternate marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, trying to place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

## Technologies Used
- **VBA (Visual Basic for Applications):** The scripting language used to develop the games, allowing them to run within Microsoft Excel.
